We present a Haskell library to help analyze
and synthesize musical counterpoint. The tool allows expression of
generic constraints in a higher-level musical language which are
translated to a lower level for use both to find rule violations in
existing musical counterpoint and generate (using an SMT solver) new
music satisfying the contraints. The tool is intended for use by
musicians who need only have a basic knowledge of Haskell.

\section{Introduction}

We demonstrate work in progress on a tool to assist in the analysis of
synthesis of musical counterpoint. Since the mid-18th century, the
composition of counterpoint has been guided by principles enunciated
in Fux's \textit{Gradus ad Parnassum} \citep{Fux1965}, first published
in 1725. Fux presents an increasingly sophisticated series of
``species'' (one note against one note, two notes against one note,
etc.) along with rules governing intervals between notes and motion
between intervals designed to ensure consonance and independence of
voices. It is well documented \citep{Mann1987} that composers
including Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven both studied and taught from
this text, and its fundamentals continue to taught to music students
today (for example \cite{Kennan1999, Aldwell2018}).

In previous work, Cong and Leo \citep{CongLeo2019} encode the rules of
first-species (note against note) counterpoint as type constructors in
the dependenty-typed language Agda. This enforces
correct-by-construction counterpoint and allows use of the Agda
typechecker to return errors with no additional effort required. On
the down side, these errors can be difficult to interpret for those
less familiar with type errors. Furthermore, encoding rules into
constructors proved awkward for handling more complex species and
more global constraints. One could separate the construction of the
pure music from the constraints which can be added as a local or
global predicate, but one may also wish to deliberately violate some
of the rules of strict counterpoint, as composers often do in
practice, and simply be informed of where the violations occur without
being prohibited from incorporating them.

Another approach then is to write a special-purpose ``type checker''
which can be run on previously-created music and which can generate
clear and precise error messages which are musically meaningful. The
checker is ideally easily customizable in terms of what constraints
one would like to impose. It turns out these constraints can be
expressed (at a low level) in the quantifier-free logic of linear
arithmetic and uninterpreted functions (QF-UFLIA \cite{Barrett2010}),
which allows one to not only analyze existing counterpoint, but also
synthesize counterpoint satisfying the constraints using an SMT
solver.

This tool, still a work in progress, has been implemented in Haskell
and is available at \cite{HaskellCounterpoint}. Haskell was chosen as
a high-quality and feature-rich SMT library called SBV \citep{SBV} is
available. It makes heavy use of functional programming, but dependent
types are sometimes missed and the goal is to eventually port the work
to the Agda Music Tools \cite{MusicTools} library.

The following sections give an overview of current
functionality. Future plans include integration with Liquid Haskell
\citep{LiquidHaskell} (for analysis) and Synquid \citep{Synquid} (for
synthesis). In addition to handling higher species we would like to
also incorporate the rules and conventions of galant schemeta
\citep{Gjerdingen2007}, which informed much of the music composed in
the era of Haydn and Mozart. Ideally one could use to tool to compose
convincing music in the galant style.

Concurrently Cong \citep{Cong2022a} is exploring another approach
using a different representation of constraints within a type system.

\section{An Example}

We briefly describe one way in which this tool can be used for both
analysis and synthesis. We first examine the example numbered 146 in
the critical edition of Beethoven's studies with Haydn
(\cite{BeethovenWerke13}; see also \cite{Nottebohm1971}, p.\ 31 and
\cite{Mann1987}, p.\ 115). It is shown in modern notation in
Figure~\ref{fig:b146}.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/b146.png}
  \caption{Beethoven Exercise 146}
  \Description{Beethoven Exercise 146}
  \label{fig:b146}
\end{figure}

Here Haydn has supplied the top voice, marked ``C.F.'' for cantus
firmus, and Beethoven's task was to supply the remaining four voices
following first species counterpoint rules. He uses only tones from
triads, all of them complete save the last and all in root position
save the second triad in bar 4. Since the notes form triads they
automatically satisfy consonance rules (only perfect intervals, thirds
or sixths between any pair of notes vertically); note that a perfect
fourth is prohibited in two part strict counterpoint but allowed with
more voices. Perfect fourths can be found between the top two voices
in the first, fourth and last bars.

There are boundary rules that the top and bottom voices must form
octaves at the beginning and end, and motion rules which are designed
to ensure independence of voices. In particular parallel and similar
(both voices moving in the same direction) motion into fifths and
octaves is prohibited. Here we can see Beethoven has in fact made two
errors in the top two voices: similar motion into a fifth in bar 3 and
then into an octave between bars 3 and 4. Haydn fixes both errors by
changing the F in the the second voice to an A.

For simplicity we now focus only on the top two voices. Feeding
Beethoven's notes into the tool as two part first species
counterpoint, it easily finds and reports errors in the use of perfect
fourths, missing octaves at the boundaries, and similar motion into
fifths and octaves. We can disable the boundary rules as they are not
relevant and relax the consance rule to allow perfect fourths, leaving
only the motion errors. We can replace the note F that Haydn fixed
with a hole, and run the tool in synthesis mode using the same
rules. It makes the same fix Haydn did. Perhaps we gave it too much
guidance, so instead we can three holes in a row near the error, which
generates the solution shown in Figure~\ref{fig:b146fix3}. Note that
this introduces a series of five parallel 6ths, and there is a ``soft''
rule that one should not have long sequences of 3rds and 6ths as that
also limits independence of voices. However we can easily add a
constraint limiting parallel intervals to at most two in a row; the
solution returned changes the G at the start of bar four to an A,
breaking the chain with a fifth, a small improvement but one might
hope for more.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/b146fix3.png}
  \caption{Three Notes Changed}
  \Description{Three Notes Changed}
  \label{fig:b146fix3}
\end{figure}

This can be done by adding a constraint to increase contrary motion
(in which both voices move in opposite directions), and in fact we can
try generating our own two part counterpoint following Haydn's cantus
firmus, and fixing the first and last notes. To help create better
quality counterpoint we add contraints to limit the number of leaps
(horizontal intervals of more than a major third) to at most one and
require at least six instances of contrary motion, which turns out to
be maximal. Note that it would be extremely difficult for a human
being with no computer help to generate counterpoint following such
restrictions, but the SMT solver instantly returns the solution shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:b146gen3}.

Thanks to Youyou Cong for many enlightening discussions about type
theory and music over the past several years, and for suggesting to
look at Beethoven's exercises as a source of examples. Emina Torlack's
class CSE 507 was invaluable for learning the fundamentals of SMT
solvers, and Stephen Rumph's classes MUHST 211 and 430 introduced me
